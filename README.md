# Office of National Statistics Birth Names

A Quarto project in R explored data from UK's ONS. Names are ranked and commented when it was first put in top 100 listings.

For 1996 - 2020 names the following data was used: <https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/datasets/babynamesinenglandandwalesfrom1996>

For historical data from 1904 - 1994 which was published every 10 years the following data was used: <https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/datasets/babynamesenglandandwalestop100babynameshistoricaldata>

Merged the data so can analyse and visualize the data.

All data belongs to [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/bulletins/babynamesenglandandwales/2020/relateddata)
